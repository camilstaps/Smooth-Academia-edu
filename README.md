# Smooth Academia.edu

![](/icons/logo-96.png)

[Academia.edu][] is omnipresent in some academic fields. Unfortunately, the
website is very frustrating in that it keeps pushing you to buy a Premium
subscription. [I also have my doubts regarding the usefulness of such a
subscription](https://twitter.com/SemiCamil/status/1226821521114632192).

This is a browser add-on that aims to smoothen your [Academia.edu][] experience
by removing links to premium features and other annoying habits.
